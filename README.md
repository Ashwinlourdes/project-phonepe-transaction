PhonePe Digital Payment Data Analysis & Dashboard
Project Overview
With increasing reliance on digital payment systems like PhonePe, understanding transaction dynamics, user engagement, and insurance data is crucial for service improvement and user targeting. This project extracts, analyzes, and visualizes PhonePe aggregate datasets across payment categories, insurance, geographical trends, and user activity. The final deliverable is an interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time exploration and insights.
Approach
Data Extraction & ETL
Clone PhonePe Pulse Dataset.

ETL process using Python (pandas) to load/transform data.

SQL Database & Tables
Set up MySQL/PostgreSQL database.

Aggregated Tables: Aggregated_user, Aggregated_transaction, Aggregated_insurance

Map Tables: Map_user, Map_map, Map_insurance

Top Tables: Top_user, Top_map, Top_insurance

Store data using well-structured schemas.

SQL Data Analysis
Write SQL queries for all business cases.
Sample queries included for segmentation, fraud, region, retention, and benchmarking.
